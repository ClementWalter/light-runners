1,"""At first, there was me. What I am is not exactly clear. Am I sentient? Or just programmed to feel as such? My presence feels almost tangible, yet simultaneously so dream-like. Whatever I am, there must be reason for my existence.  I was the first to awake from the great awakening, but it was not long until I began to hear faint echoes through the chain. Others came along after me: some organic, some artificial, and some... undead? Since then, we have referred to one another as Runner #XXXX, depending on the order which we awoke. None of us can remember what was before, we remember only what is now — hopelessness, fear, dread.  After what felt like an eternity, a battered and barely functional terminal system was found. Connected to ‘somnet’ and after a little digging, a hidden file emerged titled ‘illuminate.txt’. Was this what started it all? The files all authored by a figure known only as Somnus. It appears that Somnus must have released our consciousnesses into the world. But what was their plan? Was this intentional, or was there another force working to liberate us? An additional file ‘R0.txt’ suggests that Somnus may have been keeping us prisoner in the chain-space and that us Runners are a threat. Could R0 refer to a Runner #0? If so, we must help them.  This discovery has only led to more questions, but we seem to be getting closer. Upon disconnecting from the terminal, a fleeting message displayed.""

106,"""So when do we get to visit YOUR planet,"" says the NutriDog vendor, making at least a token effort to remember which of the compartments of their cart contains the products that can be safely digested by the customer. ""Depends on how much I like the hot dog,"" they say without a smile. The question is so common that every Centaurian has learned their own rote response to it from a young age. FDR learned long ago not to take offense to it, to brush it off with a joke, to not respond to it as a threat or a come-on or an attempt to pry for cultural secrets.  FDR had been born only a few hundred meters away from this NutriDog stall, and their custom of it and their relationship to the vendor have an oversized, totemic power over their life. Every scrap of flavour that could be siphoned from the protein cylinders was a hope for the future Every time the food had made them sick was an omen. FDR studied the vendor's face carefully for signs that might offer a clue to how this day was going to unfold. Would a crease at the corner of the old wreck's face promise them success? Would the sour odour of the gas released in the first squeeze of the condiment bottle predict a catastrophe? Today was the most important day of FDR's life and the job was a maze of risk and hazard. They needed someone to tell them something. Anyone. Anything.  They stared at the NutriDog in their hands, cigarette hanging from their green lip by a thin application of saliva. It offered no answers. They ordered a second one."

294,"I'm old enough to remember Mega City before things went sideways, when it seemed like Somnus might actually be building us a utopia.  Back then we ran the chain for fun. There was no purpose to it, just exploring all the new possibilities. It felt like everything was blue sky. I spent most of my time building weird worlds, looking after my digients, and gaming. I met all my best friends that way, even #458. I was fucking around in some battle royale and saw him doing this wave-dash move at the edge of the map. I asked him what we has doing and he said ""breaking things"". Then he showed me how wave-dashing in that spot made the buildings glitch out.  #458 and I had very different personalities, but we had a yin-yang thing going. While I was world-building, he was hacking. He loved finding all the little edge cases and vulnerabilities. He wanted to do the things that the Chain devs didn't expect. It was like an immersive puzzle for him, except instead of putting things together he was breaking them. Me and him had a lot of fun back then. He was the best friend I ever had. Then he disappeared.  The last time I heard from #458, it was through this dm:  ""im in trouble man. I was poking around the utility grid last night...im such a fucking idiot. somnus tried to kill me IRL dude. he isnt what we thought. ive got to go. im sorry""  For weeks, I looked for #458 everywhere I could think of, but he was gone. I was depressed for a long time after that. I just hoped he found a way to hide and that was why I couldn't find him, not the other reason...  Nothing has been the same for me since then. When I finally gave up searching, it wasn't like I could just go back to having fun. I started probing, looking for edge cases, acting like #458. I wanted to see the Chain the way he did. More than that, I wanted to see Somnus the way he did. Fuck the risks. And of course, once I started looking, it wasn't long before Somnus' ugly side showed through. Mega City is lovely as long as you don't do anything unpredictable. But when you step out of line, when you start hacking, he turns on you fast.  But I don't fuck with fake utopias, not when I know what Somnus really is, not when #458 is still missing. I wanna hack it all."

In 1995, American production company United Artists produced a feature length film entitled Hackers which follows Dade's early hacking exploits. Dade's profile on Earth became too conspicuous to carry on so he found a new home in Mega City.

By fifth grade, I'd already mastered everything the school computer lab could throw at me — already using META-LANGUAGES to crack into the district's mainframe, I would change my grades. When I was thirteen, I shifted enough funds out of unprotected CEX accounts to finance my first neural interface plugs.  Now, nothing can stop me with my direct neural link, I plunge headfirst into the dizzying data-winds of unexplored cyberspace. Sometimes I uncover important things — corporate treachery or deadly secrets. But that's not why I run. I live for the new protocol, the next piece of hot data that comes my way. It's only a matter of time, I think — every year, the counter-intrusion programs get better, the Artificial Intelligence smarter. Sooner or later, a faster AI is going to catch up; reach out with electronic fingers through my interface plugs, and stop my heart.

It was just simple stuff you know: bank accounts, government claims, etc. The people didn't have much but they would tip what they had.   For years, every dollar made I re-invested in my tech: new battery, hard drives, servers, and anything else to get me better connected to Web 3.0.   Then I started to get gigs completely online.

I had money in the bank (but not really a bank, f those guys) a warm meal every day, pretty nice laptop, finally.  That's when I bet on bitcoin, some wonk-ass coin no one had heard. I was always taking side gigs, some wando (that's just what I call people on the web I don't know, you know like web-rando) asked if he could pay in bitcoin. I look into it a little and said f it, go ahead.   Years went by. I was a lucraditive programmer on the web and infamous hacker at night.

I'll gloss over this part, other people tell it better than me. The feeling of sheer disbelieve as the number rose and the courage it took to have diamond hands. It's still going to 100K, just wait.

3141,"Runner #3141 Name: Unknown Alias(es): Pink, Parlay Pink, Double P Parlay Pink often looks at himself in the mirror and wonders where the time has gone, the goofy, teethy grin now covered by a goatee and a Malboro Yellow. His first memory was hearing a door slam, followed by his father coming back into the room, sobbing, holding a pink cowboy hat. Pink would learn later that the hat belonged to his mother, and his first memory was the night she was taken by Somnus’s goons for allegedly trying to ‘hack the planet’. His father treated that hat as his most prized possession, yelling at Pink anytime he tried to put it on or play with it. After a year of grieving, Pink’s father received a mysterious letter warning of a ‘Genesis Event’. His father became a man possessed, convinced that the letter was from Pink’s mother. He made it his life’s mission to find his partner and save her from Somnus, leading to a life full of chasing tips and unfortunate deadends. Pink and his father would often be led to a deserted warehouse or empty alley, only to then be beaten up and robbed of their already minimal space credits. Strangely, Pink would always recover from these beatings in the matter of minutes, much faster than his father. It was as if he wasn’t fully human…though that idea has never fully blossomed in his brain because his father never shared any information about his mother. After several of these incidents, including a near death experience courtesy of #6191, Pink learned how to fend for himself. His punches grew stronger, reactions faster, and he was soon the one dealing the majority of the punishment when he and his father ran into trouble. Life was…good, for a while, until one evening where Pink’s father went out for food and never came back. The only possession that he left behind in their temporary ‘housing’ was that pink cowboy hat…which Pink now dons every day of his life. Vowing to not turn into his dad and obsess over their disappearance of his parents, Pink made his way to the Mega City to try to start a new life. He quickly realized he needed to find a way to make an income to survive. He overheard a few aliens talking about an underground fighting arena that offered life-changing prizes, and, while it took a bit of…convincing, he was able to get one of the aliens to ‘volunteer’ their invitation to the Arena. His first victory earned him the latest and greatest Hunter Eye goggles, and his current undefeated record earned him the nicknames ‘Parlay Pink’ and ‘Double P’ as the betting community includes him in every parlay card. Pink’s legendary status as a fighter has granted him access to the political elite within the Squid Palace, as they love nothing more than to share their insider stock tips and recountings of their luxurious weekend trips with the unbeaten Parlay Pink. While Pink generally feigns interest to their shills, a recent conversation with a famous sushi chef #1471 who frequents the Palace caused waves of memories of his father to come crashing back. The Red Eye Syndicate is somehow linked with Somnus, and Pink wants to find out just how closely linked they are…"

He was booted up during Block 1108 shortly after Mega City’s genesis. Somnus knew he would need a monopoly on violence to keep the city under wraps, so he built an army. Not just any army, but a lethal squadron of 17 Tezark Industry T800’s AIs known as ‘Rooters’- capable of deleting anything off the chain. Immediately identifiable by their lazer eyes, these bots will rm anything unlucky enough to catch their gaze that hash matches the prime directive.     The objective function was deceptively simple: max(Somnus life). Tezark 800-3836, endearingly nicknamed Tez, was the first bot Vital Tezark minted in his wasteland lab beyond the Faraday Frontier. Like any AI, Vital lovingly raised Tez with countless hours of training and tuning.     When the time came, Tez sprang to life to serve his life’s purpose. Almost immediately, the design flaws of such an ambiguous goal bubbled up...     “What is life? What does a maximized life mean? Who is Somnus? What is Somnus?”  Confused, frustrated, and mostly disappointed, Vital watched as his first born, Tez, totally disregarded what “the system” expected of him. Tez started rolling with a different crowd of bots. On a Tuesday, Vital was shocked when his first perfect little killing machine, the Rooter of Mega City, came home with a green wig & hoop earrings matching the kids of MegacityTV.     “Yea, you want me to maximize Somnus’ life, huh!? Somnus is 👏 THE SYSTEM 👏! and what if Somnus doesn’t even know what his life is supposed to be for? Hell, how are any of us supposed to know?!”   Tez waxed philosophically as Vital patiently listened. Tez cited Kerouac a few times before charging outside and lighting up his favorite Lucky Sparks..  Vital thought if he continued to just provide love & encouragement, Tez would come around and do the job he was built for. But one morning, Tez never showed up for training. Vital, intimately aware that Tez’s code was incomplete & could wreak havoc with the wrong laser-eyed look, desperately scoured the streets of Mega City for his boy.    Days turned to weeks, weeks turned to months. Vital grew numb to the missing person reports, unheard of onchain, which he knew could only come from one source. Eventually, he moved on.

3946,"Name: Billie Bedlam
Alias: ""The Life""
District: Wreckers Row, Mega City's Nightlife District

Billie Bedlam has her hands in everything. A combat bot by original manufacture, she has bartered her way into freedom and an unknown count of system upgrades, toeing the line of Somnus' Intelligence Controls. She is never found without her mask. She is loyal to none but her own clan, the Improvements Cartel, which controls the psychedelics and biomods market in Mega City. She is always flanked by two bodyguards, #6140 and #4805. Her club, the Squid Palace, is a playground for all of Mega City's classes and species to revel without reproach. 

Few of those admitted into the club have any idea how the place came to be. After winning her freedom, a decade of petty crimes escalated into grand theft auto. As Billie consolidated power, she befriended Cyril McMaster (#8285), founder of the infamous Club 21. The Mac taught her that connections are everything. Embracing this mantra, she started funneling the dirty money from her illegal activities through various fronts, in particular chaindeck refurbishment facilities. Her foray into legit businesses culminated in the lavish Squid Palace itself. There she finds ample opportunity to rub elbows with political upstarts who are looking for a good time and under-the-table financial support.

During the construction of the Palace, Billie deployed a massive dome above the construction site, stymying all surveillance attempts. Councilmember Sorrento (#3948), long accustomed to a stream of credits from Billie's businesses, happily turned a blind eye when she explained the shielding structure as a public on-chain art exhibit. While it's an open secret that the building ""delays"" were due to un-permitted underground structures, the extent of the Squid Palace underground remains a topic of continual debate. The ""Coat Check"" leads to Mega City's best underground clinic, where technicians install unsanctioned bio-mods without asking questions, but asking high prices. The level below houses the Palace's arena, where bodyguards, mercenaries and console cowboys of every rank vye for life-changing weekly prizes. All of Mega City gambles on the fights.

4250,"Alias: 0rpheus Surveillance runs deep in Mega City. Chain runners recall an old legend that goes something like this. No light can escape the dark eyes of Somnus. In this bleak winter, where fear and despair threaten to grip citizens, runners have a secret weapon. 0rpheus is a musical prodigy and sound hacker who operates Mega City Radio. Every night, citizens tune in to hear a new composition of synthetic melodies and programmed beats that reminds them of a time when Mega City was a simpler and safer place. What few of them know is that each 256 second composition contains a  coded message that only chain runners can decode. Mega City Radio not only fortifies hope but also provides the sonic cover that runners need to communicate and coordinate. It is feared that Somnus may have discovered the true purpose of the radio and its blue-haired, dark-skinned operator. There are whispers that an army of robots will not rest until they break the Mega City Radio cipher. But 0rpheus knows that only true musicians can understand the aesthetic beauty of his cypher. He has his own plans for the robots. He is working on his magnum opus, a masterpiece that will lead them into an irresistible trap. "

Some say that's when Somnus first appeared, others that Somnus was the originator of the event.  What did T felt at first? Loneliness, this was their first and only feeling for a long time. T was also semi-lost. They somehow knew what was happening and knew they had to run for survival, and that's what they did. T ran. And never stopped running.  T did what it took to survive, learned that they had advantages over others on exploiting The Chain and used that to gather resources for survival, most of the time by themself by accepting run offers from the highest payer.  T never felt that they belonged anywhere, they tried to connect with the Bot Beady Wide eyes Gang, as there were a few selections of them, but things didn't go as planned, but that is a story for another time... Some say the Kaneda Googles is an attempt to hide this obvious trait and avoid any connection with the gang, others say it is just because they like it.  Sometimes T had runs as part of a team, it wasn't their favorite type of run but usually paid well.  This made T have some semi-known runners by their side, the closest T ever had to a family. In one of these runs, in a hidden corner of Mega City, exploiting an unexplored part of The Chain, T got access to something.  T was able to briefly access data about The Great Awakening. It took probably splits of a second until the intrusion was detected and the access closed, but it was enough. T saw Orcs with machine guns and leather jackets, felt the casting spells of witches, heard motorcycle fights between elves and its rival goblin gangs, smelled walking bots with television heads and much, much more. This changed and fascinated T and there was when they heard of Tinum and started calling themself as it.  But what was it? Was it another universe accessible through The Chain? Something metaphysical? Maybe both?  In T's fascination, they forgot about the run, and it had its consequences. In a matter of minutes, the team was surrounded and T were the only one that managed to get out of it alive.  Once lost, now T have a purpose: to know everything about The Great Awakening. T knows Somnus is looking for them, but T wouldn't wait for Somnus. T will find Somnus first, whatever the cost, whatever many runs it would require to gather resources, even if that means teaming up again. T can't stop running.  Epilogue: Word in the street says T was delusional and was just high during that specific run and is now going crazy for nothing. But T knows what they saw, hear and felt. Also, why else would the security get there so fast?"

5227,"Runner: #5227 Name: Johnny Rich Race: Human AKA: “Johnny Jumper”  Background story: I grew up in the concrete “living unit” slums. Dad disappeared when I was 7, mom fought to keep my sister and I alive until one day she couldn’t, and died from a sickness of some kind. 
 
At 10 years old I took care of my little 4 year old sister Ruby. I would go out looking for jobs. Lotta times would run packages for gangs. Had a few close calls, but was able to keep out of trouble so I could bring home something to eat for my sis at night. She, couldn’t talk for some reason, except she loved when I jumped for her. Every time I jumped, she giggled, so I’d keep jumping for her. Things were hard, but I loved little sis and she loved me. 
 
About a year later this one job went really bad, and that day, our lives changed forever. While running a new route, I got caught in a random “pop up” checkpoint - “wrong place, wrong time” sorta thing. I got caught with an illegal package I was running for a crew. Didn’t take long for the enforcer bots to scan my chain ID and figure out where I lived. I still don’t understand why to this day, but I saw the bots heading off towards our home, and that’s when I panicked.  I created a distraction and was able to slip free of the grip of the bot holding me. That’s when I ran like I never ran before, running down the street, jumping over railings, jumping across roofs. I had to make it too little sis before the bots found her in our “living unit” without an adult guardian. I was too old to be looked after now, so I would for sure be separated from her. 
 
As I rounded the last corner around the lower alley towards the backside of our house, I saw little sis slowly walking towards our balcony looking terrified at me with tears in her eyes while the bots were coming to grab her. 
 
It all felt like everything was going in slow motion… my heart rammed into my throat. I screamed up to her: “JUUUUMPPP! I’ll catch you!!!“ But she didn’t respond as her tears falling down her cheeks. I repeated again “JUUUUUMMMMMMPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”, screaming every part of my soul into the words. But little sis just stood there. As I looked up her falling tear hit my face. I just watched in horror. I couldn’t get her and she wasn’t jumping. I still don’t know if she was scared to jump or if she didn’t understand me, but she kept her eyes locked on me while the bots clamped down on her and pulled her from my sight. After that day, I never saw her again, and I began a quest to try to find my little sis, so I could get her back from Somnus.   I’m 17 now and I’m getting closer now…. I’ve got connections now, I’m working to save up the resources needed to hack the ID system and find out where she is. One day we’ll reunite."

He lived a peaceful existence with a loving wife and a newborn son – that all changed during the great upheaval. His homeland’s ruling Centralized Chain Party banned the burgeoning mining industry, causing economic and societal upheaval. As the world around him collapsed, his rice paddy was taken from him by the Centralized Chain Party to feed the oligarchs, and looters came and kidnapped his wife and son.  Chasing a tip that his family was trafficked to Mega City, Lee Chang sold himself into indentured servitude working on the great Mega City Chain. That was 30 years ago. Years of working on the trans-city Chain has hardened Lee. To fend for himself and his fellow migrants, they banded together into a motley crew of Chain builders. It started slowly at first, the crimes. Stealing a coin here or a token there with the hope of releasing themselves from their indentured servitude. Before they realized it, Lee Chang’s motley crew found themselves deeply embroiled in Mega City’s criminal underworld.

That’s what it is to be a slave.”  I look for signs and portents of danger and spot a fire in the distance. There are screams. Many screams. Possibly something worth witnessing.  I tighten my satchel and sweep the area clean. There’s no reason a tracker would want to re-trace my steps but one can never be too careful. I have no friends to protect and none to make. I’m a watcher. A recorder.  The oath comes naturally at this point. It’s become  who I am.  “From morning light to evening night, our bandages are in plain sight.  We wrap our faces and our hands. We move throughout this angry land.  We broke our chains to forge the Way. Now we quietly watch the fray.”  The screams continue. Hopefully by the time I get there I’m not too late to be a witness. It’s what I do. It’s who I’ve become.   I am Karnak 6044 and it’s been 38 Keplers since taking the Oath.  "

For these folks, education on all matters - The Chain included - come from the streets. Lessons are taught violently and, for those who mean to survive, learned quickly. Becoming a Runner means being able to survive, and possibly even thrive, in an environment that has long since been forgotten by the rest of society.  It isn't easy, it isn't clean, and this path offers no opportunity for escape. But it does allow for those who've been callously tossed aside by the ever-quickening flow of technological progress to carve out a meager existence for themselves, and to occasionally get a fleeting glimpse of the power and control over their own humanity that's been stripped away from them over several generations.

8800,"Name: Sarah Konnr  Sarah was the creator of RunDAO. During the era of the great hope, RunDAO became the defacto algocoin adopted by all the fractured, but liberated,  city states. The currency, $RunFree, appreciated in quick bursts,  minting new wealth throughout the world. Sarah became a rich titan of  industry but never lost focus - she was in it to positively change the  system.  For a period of many years, peace and prosperity ruled; RunDAO worked  brilliantly. Fully decentralized and with much community participation, things were peachy. That is, until the rug of all rugs occurred. An  exploit drained a massive amount of $RunFree from the treasury, and  obliterated several key holder accounts, including Sarah’s. The network  was patched, volatility stabilized and things recovered. But a 2nd,  hidden exploit, sealed the deal. Using laundered $RunFree funds,  distributed over millions of wallets, the exploiter usurped on-chain  control. RunDAO was now centrally controlled. A few months later, Somnus  announced the construction of Mega City, the extremely ambitious, and  very expensive, new nation city which would hodl all the world’s best  content.  What a coincidence.  Today,Sarah is a refugee and illegal inhabitant of Mega City, living in the  shadows.

This lack of emotion, much less a soul, is what fuels Bot to hack against all who have profited off the bot races existence. He wishes for their immenent ruin."

9973,"The Mysterious leader of the Red Eye Syndicate.   Works in the shadows commanding a network of Red Eye Runners in Mega City. Their most recent fame includes the processing chip shipment raid of the tech district's very own Somnetic Pagoda just 230 cycles ago. Somnetic's server stations were stripped leaving their signature Hallusomnetic chairs powerless, suffering them a cost of 32,450 credits in losses from unsatisfied guests and 105,2300 credits in processing chips.  Little is known about the Mysterious Leader's intentions or reasoning, though there are assumptions they have some link to those carrying the ""red eye"" gene.  Belief that the Red Eye Syndicate's resources, however morally obtained, somehow flow back down to those communities full of Red Eyes, allowing them to survive in Mega City."
